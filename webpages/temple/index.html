    <p>St. George Utah Temple was announced November 9, 1871, dedicated April 6, 1877, and rededicated November 11, 1975.</p>

    <p><q>“As we come to rededicate this lovely edifice—newly enlarged, cleansed, refurbished—our memories return to the beginnings when loyal, devout people, who were hardly settled from their long, painful, and distressing exodus across the plains, were again uprooted and sent to this desert place to colonize the valleys of the mountains and to build the first temple west of the Mississippi River,”</q> said President Kimball during the prayer of rededication for the temple in 1975.</p>
