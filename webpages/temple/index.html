    <p>St. George Utah Temple was announced November 9, 1871, dedicated April 6, 1877, and rededicated November 11, 1975.</p>

    <p><q>As we come to rededicate this lovely edifice—newly enlarged, cleansed, refurbished—our memories return to the beginnings when loyal, devout people, who were hardly settled from their long, painful, and distressing exodus across the plains, were again uprooted and sent to this desert place to colonize the valleys of the mountains and to build the first temple west of the Mississippi River,</q> said President Kimball during the prayer of rededication for the temple in 1975.</p>
   
    <h2>Temples</h2>
    <div class="news">
    <p>Temples are the most sacred places of worship on earth. Each one is literally a house of the Lord﻿—a place where He and His spirit may dwell, where He may come or send others to confer priesthood blessings and to give revelation to His people.</p>

    <p>John A. Widtsoe wrote: “I believe that the busy person on the farm, in the shop, in the office, or in the household, who has his worries and troubles, can solve his problems better and more quickly in the house of the Lord than anywhere else … , for at the most unexpected moments, in or out of the temple will come to him, as a revelation, the solution of the problems that vex his life.”</p>

    <p>Temples built especially to the Lord have been erected in all ages. Moses built a tabernacle, a sort of portable temple, in the wilderness for the children of Israel. Solomon built a magnificent temple in Jerusalem. The Nephites built sacred temples. Joseph Smith built houses of the Lord in Kirtland and Nauvoo, and later prophets have built temples throughout the world. These have all been built under the direction and revelation of God.</p>

    <p>The Jewish people have looked forward to the return to the earth of the prophet Elijah, as promised by the prophet Malachi. Each year faithful Jews observe a Passover feast at which they leave a door open so that Elijah might come in and celebrate with them.</p>

    <p>“It was … on the third day of April, 1836,” said President Joseph Fielding Smith, “that the [Jewish people], in their homes at the [Passover] feast, opened their doors for Elijah to enter. [However,] on that very day Elijah did enter﻿—not in the home of the Jews but he appeared in the House of the Lord.” (See Conference Report, April 1936, page 75.)</p>
